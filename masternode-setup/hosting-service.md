## COMA node

The Hub also offers a very practical masternode hosting service that does not require a desktop wallet or technical skills called *Clientless On Cloud Masternode Service*. Thanks to this, the user can immediately participate in the super validation processes operated by the masternodes and receive the due rewards.

At the same time the user can maximize his "passive income" by automatically staking the rewards, or by adding coin packets through transactions to his receiving addresses.

This "cloud" solution also allows participants to manage the LYRA digital currency from any device. Finally, two-factor authentication (2FA) processes make the deposit and withdrawal processes extremely secure.
