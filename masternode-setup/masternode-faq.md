# Masternode FAQ

**Q: HOW MANY LYRA COINS ARE NEEDED FOR A MASTERNODE, AND HOW DO I DEVELOP IT?**

A: You will need a total of 15000 LYRA. Follow this setup guide.

**Q: WHAT IS A SHARED MASTERNODE AND HOW CAN I ACCESS IT?**

A: Through specific services, users can group their funds to reach the 15,000 LYRA required to manage a masternode.

Shared masternodes are based on trust in the service operator. The Scrypta team recommends using extreme caution when participating in a shared masternode group.
The platforms that allow you to participate in "share" of Masternode Scrypta are:

[EvoNodes](https://evonodes.com/)

[Midas Platform](https://midas.investments/shares)

**Q: HOW MUCH IS IT POSSIBLE TO EARN FROM A MASTERODE SCRYPTA?**

A: The profits of a Masternode vary according to the value of the coin, the percentage of rewards obtained by the nodes and how many nodes are online. There are specific platforms that provide this data in real time:

[Masternodes Online](https://masternodes.online/currencies/LYRA/)

[Masternode Buzz](https://coins.masternode.buzz/LYRA)

**Q: I HAVE JUST STARTED A MASTERNODE, HOW LONG WILL I WAIT FOR THE FIRST REWARD?**

A: When you start the masternode for the first time, you will have to wait to receive the first reward. This waiting time is to prevent masternode owners from constantly reducing their masternodes and restoring them to take advantage of the balanced "staking rewards" of the see-saw algae.

The first Masternode reward can take up to 24 times more than the average reward time.

The average reward time can be checked on masternode statistical sites such as [Masternodes Online](https://masternodes.online/currencies/LYRA/).

** Q: IF MY MASTERODE GENKEY WAS STOLEN FROM ME, COULD SOMEONE STOLEN MY LYRA? **

A: No, they can't steal your coins directly. However, they can use it to disable your masternode, effectively stopping the network flow.

** Q: WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF A MASTERNODE FOR NETWORK? **

A: Masternodes acts as a reliable node on the network, allowing easier data propagation and faster transmission of transaction information. It also enables features like * SwiftTX * which allows transactions to be executed with a single confirmation, while a normal transaction requires six.
