# QR Scrypta Card Wallet

The card wallet is not only manageable through NFC. It is possible to create a card wallet in paper format and use it for reading with the QR code.

The advantage of this type of solution is cost-effectiveness and certainly the most immediate creation of dApps, as the QR code reading functionality also exists in normal web apps.
