# NFC Scrypta Card Wallet 

The card wallet completes the Scrypta identity system by providing a simple, secure and powerful tool. The card can be used both to create secure and long-lasting backups of your wallets or can be created for the daily management of your Lyra, your information or as a payment system within the Sidechains.

The card is nothing more than the physical representation of what has often been called *".sid file"*, or the digital representation of a Scrypta identity. The size of these files, which we remember to be encrypted, requires **NFC** card with **NTAG216** chip which allows you to write up to 888 bytes of information.

Like any other Scrypta technology, it is easily replicable. The crucial node, for the safety of users, is to generate strong passwords that can protect the private keys contained within the card.

To generate the cards we have created a special tool, available here:

[https://github.com/scryptachain/scrypta-card-generator](https://github.com/scryptachain/scrypta-card-generator)

This tool allows you to create an infinite number of cards and save a *.csv* file containing the information necessary for writing them in series.

More information on using the tool can be found in the section:

[**Card Generator**](../utilities/card-generator.md)

## Use

Once a card wallet has been created, it can be used as a tool to carry out operations within the blockchain in a simple way, or by entering your password (or PIN) within a trusted application.

Between all, [Manent App](../dapps/manent-app.md) e [Manent Web](../dapps/manent-web.md) are those that allow you to test this technology, with the possibility of exchanging Lyra *-on the fly-* through the *Receive* section.

After entering the amount to be received, it is possible to request the payment of the amount through the card; this will be read and subsequently decoded thanks to the insertion of the password by the debtor.

If the password is correct and the funds are actually available, a transaction will be made containing the requested Lyra amount. The *fees* for the transaction will only be those relating to the blockchain, which we remember to be **0.001 LYRA**.

We have therefore created a perfect POS system, where the fees are actually 0 for the merchant and the security of the exchanges is very high.

The password, the private key or the wallet itself are never stored by the device, making all exchange operations secure.

## Token and Sidechain

This card does not, of course, contain only the information relating to LYRA, but contains all the information relating to the tokens created through the Scrypta Sidechain system - [**Planum**] (../ planum / README.md). This means that each token can actually be exchanged in a *physical* way (through the card) using blockchain technology in an absolutely transparent way for the user.

If you are wondering what the areas of application of such a technology can be, think about: company canteens, shopping vouchers, gift cards, restaurant tickets, tickets for events and concerts, and so on.

The card wallet represents the simplest and most immediate tool for an end user who prefers to have a tangible tool.
