# Identification platform

## Premise

The Scrypta digital identity framework allows the coupling of a Lyra address to one or more digital and / or physical identifiers.

Scrypta provides a privacy oriented public *Gateway* that will allow you to interact with identification technology. This *Gateway* can be reached at: [https://me.scrypta.id](https://me.scrypta.id)

Once inside the system with your `.sid` file you can interact with all the available identifiers:

- CIE (Electronic Identity Card),
- Mail (also PEC),
- Mobile phone,
- Google account,
- Twitter,
- Linkedin,
- Github,
- Ethereum (ETH address).

For more information on the *.sid* file and the login system in the Scrypta dApps, visit the [Scrypta Browser Extension](../dapps/extension-browser.md) section.
