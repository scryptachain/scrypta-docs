# Intro

The digital identity within the Scrypta Blockchain is managed through two different components:

1. The "pseudonymous identity" component - an alphanumeric string of the type - * LV5RkA9AL6ncM19RT3usKRkxd5arUS7iVt * - which allows the digital signature to be coupled to a natural or legal person.

2. The "digital signature" component, a kind of encryption password, which allows you to carry out the technical operations of signing transactions and data.
   
The correct identification of the subject leads to the creation of a **identity payload** that is digitally signed and written in blockchain to consolidate its representation (hash).

## Gateway

This correct identification is carried out by means of a **Gateway**, or a trusted third party who assumes responsibility for the identification itself.

Here we see an **example** of identification:

[https://proof.scryptachain.org/#/uuid/b5e6914d.0198.4390.a85e.c9722fb1e259](https://proof.scryptachain.org/#/uuid/b5e6914d.0198.4390.a85e.c9722fb1e259)

As you can guess, no personal data is saved within the blockchain, revealing itself as a tool with ***privacy by design***.

> It is the Gateway that acts as a "certification body", be it a company or an organization, or a government agency, and will take care of creating an **offline** digital archive (as we recommend), which will allow it to trace the correct identification of users, and as a tool of KYC (Know Your Customer).


The identity payload is also delivered to the user who will keep it within their devices (Card, Mobile, PC) and will be necessary for the processes of exchange of personal information between users, companies, entities.

::: tip NOTE
By creating their own digital identity, the user can also easily use, even in a pseudonymous form, all the [Scrypta dapps](../dapps/README.md).


Identities (and their address) can be created through:

- [Manent App](../dapps/manent-app.md)

- [ScryptaID Browser Extension](../dapps/extension-browser.md)

- [Scrypta Card](../dapps/manent-app.md#scrypta-card)
