# Scrypta Browser Extension
The Scrypta browser extension is a useful tool for creating, using and managing Scrypta identities on all online and offline dApps.

![scrypta_id](../.vuepress/public/assets/scryptaid/banner.png)

The browser extension creates a secure environment for saving and managing Scrypta identities (also called **.Sid files**).
These identities are injected directly into the Scrypta dApps (the official ones at least) and, through a simple graphical interface, you can create new identities and modify existing ones.

## Links to stores

The extension can be downloaded both on Chromium browsers (Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, etc) and on Firefox:
- **Chrome web Store**:
[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scryptaid/kphclbededgemedgbfgblpmdccjbbhdm](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scryptaid/kphclbededgemedgbfgblpmdccjbbhdm)
- **Firefox Add-ons**: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scryptaid/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scryptaid/)

## Main operations
Once the installation of the extension has been completed in your browser, the symbol marked with the icon <img src = ".././.Vuepress/public/assets/scryptaid/icon256.png" width = "will appear at the top right 26 ">, placed next to the other extensions already installed. <br>![scrypta_id](../.vuepress/public/assets/scryptaid/ext.png)

At the first launch of the extension, we will be asked if we want to create a new identity or import an existing one.

## Identity Creation

When starting the extension for the first time, to create an identity just press the **"CREATE IDENTITY"** button, this screen will open:

![Create new Identity](../.vuepress/public/assets/scryptaid/create_id.png)

Choose the label that identifies the identity you are creating, and choose a **secure password**.<br>

**ATTENTION:**<br>Since the .sid file linked to your identity will be used to use all Scrypta dApps, it is recommended to write down or remember the identity password.

Losing the password will no longer be possible to recover it, for example losing access to any funds contained in the wallet, data uploaded through Manent and everything connected to that identity within all the dApps of the Scrypta ecosystem.

Once the identity has been created, the extension main page will open where you can see **name** and **address** associated with the identity in use, as well as the main functions to be used<br>![scrypta_id](../.vuepress/public/assets/scryptaid/id_screen.png)

## dApp Explorer
The dApp explorer provides quick links to the official Scrypta dApps.

![dApp Explorer](../.vuepress/public/assets/scryptaid/dapps_explorer.png)<br>

By clicking on the dApp of your interest, you will be redirected to the page of the dApp in question.<br>Once you have reached the dApp page, open the extension and click on **"USE THIS IDENTITY"**.<br>Then the page it will reload and you are logged in!

## Manage IDs

From this page you can manage one or more identities, change primary identities, import an existing identity or create new ones.
