# Introduction

The digital identity within the Scrypta Blockchain is managed through two different components:

1. The "pseudonymous identity" component - an alphanumeric string of the type - *LV5RkA9AL6ncM19RT3usKRkxd5arUS7iVt* -  which allows the digital signature to be coupled to a natural or legal person.

2. The "digital signature" component, a kind of encryption password, which allows you to carry out the technical operations of signing transactions and data.
   
The correct identification of the subject leads to the creation of a **identity payload** that is digitally signed and written in blockchain to consolidate its representation (hash).

## Certification and verification

Scrypta ID is the first tool that connects the electronic identity document (CIE) to the blockchain. By creating a specific message that is signed in blockchain and countersigned through the Electronic Identity Card, the user can associate his blockchain address with the credentials issued by the Ministry of the Interior and thus perform certified operations.

Your identity can also be associated with the ownership of various services, such as: your mobile number, your email or PEC, your social networks such as Twitter or Linkedin, or even addresses of other blockchains such as Ethereum.

To use the identity verification tool, go to the identification site: [https://scrypta.id](https://scrypta.id/en).

## Gateway

Correct identification can take place through the [verification tool](https://scrypta.id/en) made available by Scrypta, or it can be carried out by means of a **Gateway**: a trusted third party who assumes the responsibility for identification itself.

Here we see an **example** of identification:

[https://proof.scryptachain.org/#/uuid/b5e6914d.0198.4390.a85e.c9722fb1e259](https://proof.scryptachain.org/#/uuid/b5e6914d.0198.4390.a85e.c9722fb1e259)

As you can guess, no personal data is saved within the blockchain, revealing itself as a tool with ***privacy by design***.

> It is the Gateway that acts as a "certifying body", be it a company or an organization, or a government body, and will be responsible for creating an **offline** digital archive (as we recommend), which will allow it to trace the correct identification of users, and as a tool of KYC (Know Your Customer).


The identity payload is also delivered to the user who will keep it within their devices (Card, Mobile, PC) and will be necessary for the processes of exchange of personal information between users, companies, entities.

> By creating their own digital identity, the user can also easily use, even in a pseudonymous form, all the [Scrypta dapps](../dapps/README.md).


Identities (and their address) can be created through:

- [Manent App](../wallet/manent-app.md)

- [ScryptaID Browser Extension](../dapps/start.md)

- [Scrypta Card](../wallet/manent-app.md#scrypta-card)
