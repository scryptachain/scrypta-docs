# Scrypta Card ID

Users' identities are physically represented through a digital file (.sid file) or through cards.

The cards can be of three types:

- Physical card with QR Code - readable by devices with camera and developable in Web App format.

- Physical Card with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology,readable only via APP (Android, iOS) from latest generation mobile devices.
    
- Virtual Card with QR-Code, which can be sent by e-mail or link and can be read by devices with a camera.

Each card, of any type, is equipped with a progressive identification number and a unique PIN (numeric password) which it will be necessary to enter to digitally sign or implement other blockchain operations.

The cards with QR-Code not having internal electronic chips, are certainly cheaper and require a unique print of the QR-Code assigned to each card. They do not require the development of a mobile APP but of a Web App which allows much shorter realization times.
