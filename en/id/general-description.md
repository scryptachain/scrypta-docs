# General Description
Scrypta ID is a framework that allows you to create and manage advanced digital identity systems through the blockchain.
Each identity has a digital signature and a unique address on the Scrypta blockchain. Each user is identified in a decentralized way or through a proprietary gateway, by means of a cross-check with external providers; in particular:

- CIE (Electronic Identity Card)
- E-Mail (also PEC)
- Mobile phone number
- Google account
- Twitter
- Linkedin
- Github
- Ethereum (ETH address)

## Scrypta ID features
The strengths of the digital identity framework developed by Scrypta:

### Privacy by Design
No personal data are saved on the blockchain. The identity payload is kept by the user within his own devices.

### Open Source
Scrypta ID is an open, modular and adaptable framework, and can be used for various types of services where there is a need for user identification and verification.

### Interoperable
Various levels of authentication and interoperability thanks to PassportJS, Mailgun and Twilio that allow you to interact with different external providers (Google, e-mail, etc …).
Scrypta ID can also interacts with other blockchains (ETH).

### Easy to use
The card wallet completes the Scrypta identity system by providing a practical, simple and safe tool to be used in the authentication processes.

### Integration with Electronic Identity Card
Scrypta ID is the first tool that connects the electronic identity document to the blockchain. By taking advantage of the benefits of distributed ledger technology, you can thus take full advantage of the control over your personal data.

## Identity and signature

The digital identity within the Scrypta Blockchain is managed through two different components:

1. The “public digital identity” component: commonly called blockchain address — an alphanumeric string of the type: LV5RkA9AL6ncM19RT3usKRkxd5arUS7iVt — unique for each subject.

2. The “digital signature” component: which can be represented as a system of digital keys and passwords, allows technical digital signature operations to be carried out.

The correct identification of the subject leads to the creation of an identity “payload” that is digitally signed and written in blockchain.

## Certification and verification

Scrypta ID is the first tool that connects the electronic identity document (CIE) to the blockchain. By creating a specific message that is signed in blockchain and countersigned through the Electronic Identity Card, the user can associate his blockchain address with the credentials issued by the Ministry of the Interior and thus perform certified operations.

Your identity can also be associated with the ownership of various services, such as: your mobile number, your email or PEC, your social networks such as Twitter or Linkedin, or even addresses of other blockchains such as Ethereum.
