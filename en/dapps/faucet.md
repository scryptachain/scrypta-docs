Scrypta Foundation has designed a special rewards bot in LYRA for Twitter users. Users can receive LYRA by following our official page "@scryptachain", retweeting our posts with the #scrypta and #scryptachain.

## How it Works

First, the user who wants to receive rewards in LYRA must start following our official Twitter page @scryptachain, the more interactions you make the more rewards you will get.<br><br> 

The second step involves synchronizing the user's account with the bot, authorize the bot to access their account. After accepting, the application shows the user his private key and the Lyra address on which he receives rewards for his interactions. Also, you can see all the details of the Scrypta account that the user has created. <br><br>

The next thing to do is to import the private key into the Manent browser extension or directly into the desktop wallet where you can manage your funds. <br><br>

Once these steps are completed the user, by commenting, quoting and sharing @scryptachain, can receive up to 4 LYRA per day. <br><br>

To receive the rewards there are some simple rules to follow: your profile must have been created at least 60 days ago, you must allow at least 360 minutes between interactions, you must have a minimum of 75 followers. Only in this way you can receive up to a maximum of 4 LYRA per day! <br>
