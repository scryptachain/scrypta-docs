![dapps](/assets/other/dapps.png)

This document will describe all the dApps created by Scrypta, providing both technical documentation and an explanation of how they work. It is important to remember that some are still in development and others have remained (and will remain) only MVPs. Use them as examples and demonstrations of the technologies developed by Scrypta (ID, IdANode, Identity and Trustlink) and implement them in order to create your product.
