# Exchanges

Exchanges are the most popular virtual places to trade cryptocurrency. There is a wide range of exchanges, each with slightly different characteristics. Some offer multiple markets, some are in direct competition, some have cheaper commissions and others are subject to more or less rigid regulatory requirements.

Most exchanges are centralized, meaning that they are managed by a single company, which can be forced by the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates to collect data on its customers. Others are decentralized, where as a result you are dealing with peer-to-peer rather than with a more or less authorized entity.

The exchanges can also be further divided into two categories: exchanges that accept national currency (legal currency) and exchanges that only deal in cryptocurrencies.

For security reasons, exchanges should not be used as electronic wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for storing cryptocurrencies.
