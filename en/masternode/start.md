# Masternode Setup

To activate one or more Scrypta masternodes you will need the [official desktop wallet](../wallet/fullnode.md) and the collateral required of **15,000 LYRA** for each masternode.

::: warning NOTE
If you want to proceed for a manual installation, you must keep in mind that the process requires technical skills, a VPS server with a dedicated IP address and time for installation.
:::

Alternatively, you can use masternode hosting services such as [The Hub](../masternode-setup/hosting-service.md).
