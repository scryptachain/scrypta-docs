# Staking On Cloud

## Staking with TheHub VBox

For staking in the cloud we suggest the Staking Vbox service offered by [The Hub](https://thehub.host/). 

This tool allows you to obtain all the advantages of a Full Node Scrypta with 24-hour staking, and has functions such as "saving" private keys, backing up the "*wallet.dat*" file, "wallet encryption" custom and two-factor authentication (2FA).
