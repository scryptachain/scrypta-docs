# React dApp Starter
Written in React, it allows you to create a Progressive Web App connected with Scrypta Blockchain.

You can download the code from here:
[**dApp Starter React:**](https://github.com/scryptachain/scrypta-react-dapp-starter).

## Start the project in development mode

To develop the project it is first necessary to clone the repository through the command:

```
git clone https://github.com/scryptachain/scrypta-react-dapp-starter
```
then you need to go into the folder and install the dependencies:

```
cd scrypta-dapp-starter
npm install
```

Finally start the development server:

```
npm start
```

## dApp Deployment

Once the dApp is completed, it can be compiled using the command:

```
npm run build
```

and therefore it can be uploaded to an online server, a browser extension, Electron as a desktop app etc. The important aspect is that the dApps will perform well-defined operations in the accounts of the users who activate them and will use their computational power to perform calculations or perform other operations.

If you have specific needs from the backend and database point of view, it is clear that you can use the same code in a hybrid way, also using a central server.
