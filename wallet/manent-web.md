## Wallet creation and login

If you don't have a wallet yet, you can create one quickly and easily by entering an encryption password of your choice, which will be kept and remembered for future access.

In case you have already created a portfolio or are already using **Manent App**, you can access the **Manent Web** portfolio in several ways:
- By selecting a .sid file generated by **Manent App** or via **ScryptaID**.
- Using the **ScryptaID** extension directly through your web browser.
