# Scrypta Blockchain

## LYRA 
The exchange and insertion of data in the Scrypta infrastructure takes place thanks to the transactions made in LYRA. LYRA is a "digital asset" and not a "token" as it has a proprietary blockchain called Scrypta.

The operating cost for inserting data in the Scrypta blockchain is equal to thousandths of LYRA per operation. This allows the construction of complex infrastructures on a solid but at the same time accessible and low-cost basis.

## PoS (Proof-of-Stake) 
The Proof-of-Stake algorithm used by Scrypta acts to validate transactions and obtain distributed consensus. With the Proof of Stake, the creator of a new block is chosen in a deterministic way according to its 'wealth', defined as 'stake'. 

The Scrypta consensus algorithm selects a validator every 60 seconds and assigns it the right to create a single block. The blockchain is therefore based on incentive nodes to maintain an "economic participation" in the network. In other words, it means that the "digital wallet" open to the network, generate new coins and ensure a passive income. 

The developers and the Scrypta community use the Proof of Stake for a more "green" and therefore less expensive form of accord. Thanks to the PoS system, validators have not use their computing power because the only factors that influence their chances of being rewarded are the number of their "locked   coins and the healthy competition between  stakeholders.

## Masternode 
A masternode is a server, online 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which works as super validator and it is rewarded in LYRA. 

The masternodes perform standard node functions such as hosting a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions on the network, and they also act as shareholders, voting for proposals to improve the Scrypta ecosystem. 

Masternodes also allow other important features like "SwiftX" for Instant Transaction and "Obfuscation" to increase users privacy. 

Operating as a masternode validator requires ownership of 15,000 LYRA. 

Masternodes must also have a static IP address and meet the minimum requirements for CPU, RAM, disk space, and network bandwidth.
