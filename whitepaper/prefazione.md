# Prefazione

**Scrypta** is a blockchain with advanced decentralized functionality and is suitable as an infrastructure for the realization of complete architectures at the service of unlimited projects and new use cases.

The Scrypta ecosystem offers exceptional archiving, certification and verification functions that represent excellent tools for all companies and public administrations that want to take advantage of the technological innovation offered by the blockchain.

Scrypta is a **peer-to-peer infrastructure** designed to develop new business models and public governance management. The system is based on the digital currency called "**LYRA**". Scrypta's hashing algorithm ensures high-speed transactions and instant payments.

The monetary issue scheme, and therefore the distribution of the rewards for the network, is based on **QUARK** which has a **PoS/Masternode** consensus layer which is energy efficient and safe.

Scrypta is a constantly evolving **open-source** project - This makes it particularly suitable for collaborations and contributions from developers who want to create practical solutions based on its architecture.

Scrypta was born from the idea of a cohesive group of innovators. Everything you read in this document is already functional: the code is already developed, tested and operational.
