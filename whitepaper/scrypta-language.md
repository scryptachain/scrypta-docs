# Scrypta Language

Each application, whether centralized or decentralized, requires two fundamental entities: data (file) and storage (database). Through Scrypta it is possible to insert data into the blockchain and to create complex and decentralized storage systems. 

Scrypta has create innovative blockchain interface techniques that allow developers to contrive specific decentralized applications using standard web programming languages. This area is mainly represented by the special **RESTful APIs**, developed for the information writing and reading into the Scrypta Blockchain. 

In particular, the structure is based on what we have defined **Interconnected dApp Node (IdA Node)** that uses the most common development languages such as PHP, NodeJS and MongoDB and basically aid to decipher all the underlying and complex operations that are carried out by the end user of an application. 

The founder of Scrypta also, through the union of the IdA Nodes and the Masternodes, designed a basic infrastructure on which to base the **IPFS (Inter Planetary File System)** technology: an innovative technique to create decentralized and distributed file storage system that can contain permanently large amounts of data, files and hypermedia. 

In summary, the technologies and the languages used by Scrypta are:

• **MN / PoS (Masternode / Proof of Stake) Blockchain**, well tested against attacks of various kinds. 

• The **interface node 'IdA Nodes'**, which incorporate the most common development languages such as PHP, NodeJS and MongoDB and basically are useful to decipher all the complex operations that are carried out by the final user of a decentralized application. 
 
• **Common Web language,** which its used to create the user interface and is mainly represented by Javascript and the special **RESTful APIs**, created for writing and reading data in the Scrypta Blockchain.
