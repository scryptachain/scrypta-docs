# Application Areas

As already established, the blockchain has had an important impact in the financial sector, with evident benefits in terms of data processing speed, transparency, security, however these benefits can be applied to many other economic, productive and social sectors, namely in any sector on which multiple intermediaries insist. Here are some potential areas of application of Scrypta:

## Production chain
The blockchain allows you to create open supply chains in which all the players, such as producers of raw materials, companies that deal with logistics and transport, companies that operate on raw materials at various levels of transformation, companies that work on packaging and marketing and, finally, retailers can provide data and information and check the data of all the other players with the utmost transparency. The data relating to each product can be put to the benefit of the final consumer.

Our technological proposition has the potential to allow not only manufacturers, but also their customers, to enter an innovative chapter of traceability in the supply chain. The Scrypta Blockchain can guarantee a clear information flow free from irregularities. And we can push ourselves to imagine a near future in which a "scan" of the label of a product can show the customer the path from the source to the final user.

## Industrial IoT (Internet of Things)
The Scrypta Blockchain is a candidate for the role of key application for the Industrial IoT (Internet of Things). In fact, it can be used to track myriads of connected devices, allowing the processing of data transactions that they produce and coordination between physical devices.

This decentralized approach would eliminate the points of failure of traditional networks, facilitating the creation of an ecosystem on which connected devices and machinery can operate.

The blockchain serves as a public ledger for a massive amount of data and this would bypass the use of a central hub to manage and mediate communication between devices. Furthermore, the cryptographic algorithms used by Scrypta would allow to increase the protection and authenticity of the data.

## Public administration
The architecture of Scrypta can radically change the system of relations between citizens and the PA due to a decentralized and distributed logic, which leads to greater transparency, greater security and accessibility.

Imagine the use of the blockchain in the context of public record keeping, document conservation, digital identities, payments, tax collection up to voting mechanisms.

## Copyright, patents and contracts
Thanks to the Scrypta blockchain, it is possible to insert documents as supporting evidence during legal disputes that unequivocally demonstrate the ownership of a work or document.

There are two characteristics that make Scrypta particularly relevant to the certification system: "hashing" and "proof of existence" (Proof of Existence). Hashing is a process by which a document is transformed into a fixed-length code that is defined with a fingerprint. Each hash is unique.

As for the "Proof of Existence", it shows that a certain hash existed at a certain time. Demonstrating its existence means providing proof that a certain document existed at a fixed time, this process is called "timestamping". This opportunity is considered particularly interesting in all processes that touch the subject of intellectual property, patents and certifications.

## Health
Managing the medical data of patients through the blockchain, will allow to share information on patients in a safe and fast way, and therefore would greatly help medicine and healthcare to improve the service offered, with the possibility of having the entire medical record of a patient, and therefore to know his history in advance, in order to administer better and faster treatments.

The blockchain is also a response in terms of managing complex scenarios concerning the presence and interaction between interregional health systems, between private entities such as analytical laboratories, private health structures or even insurance companies.
Scrypta's blockchain technology can also speed up the control procedures and operating mechanisms of hospitals and can bring very important efficiencies in terms of secure document management.

## E-commerce
Four are the benefits of the Scrypta Blockchain in the field of electronic commerce:
Fight against counterfeiting: ecommerce platforms can verify the authenticity of each product before displaying it to the public, to guarantee both the customer and their image.

Optimization of the Supply Chain: as we have seen in the section relating to the production chain.

Speed ​​up payment processes: which currently involve a plethora of players on both the customer and merchant side. With the Blockchain, the need for a central authorization body is eliminated, making the payment process practically in real time.

Transaction security: the immutable and decentralized nature of the blockchain makes it impossible to alter the data and therefore eliminates the possibility of fraudulent transactions.

## IT Security
With the adoption of databases based on Scrypta, an important reduction in hacking, tampering and intrusion activities in company databases can be envisaged. Not only are distributed ledgers currently more secure than many traditional systems, but blockchain effectively eliminates the need for intervention by operators, thus reducing the risks associated with human error.

## Traceability of Waste
In this sector, the Scrypta Blockchain would function as a real verification system that would allow to detect quality, quantity of material and origin, in order to trace the entire history of the supply chain, facilitating the relationship between the actors involved in terms of reliability and safety. Furthermore, the blockchain, again in relation to the waste management phase, can be used as a tool to encourage virtuous behavior of citizens.

## Finance and Banks
The Scrypta Blockchain can help banks to provide services more suited to the needs of highly innovative companies and at the same time to have the most accurate information on the client company.

## Insurance
Insurers would have in the Scrypta Blockchain an opportunity to reduce the costs of their management platforms, at the same time improve the user experience (customer experience) and develop new solutions and opportunities through improved access to data.
