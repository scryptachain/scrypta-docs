# The Blockchain Today

● 2017/2018 was a crucial two-year period for the development of the entire blockchain ecosystem. Companies and startups have often focused almost exclusively on the lucrative and financial aspects, putting the language and potential of the blockchain in the background.

● The advent of Ethereum as a code creation and maintenance system (also called Smart Contract) has not yet reached the widespread adoption that was expected. Ethereum's enormous potential lies precisely in Smart Contracts and their implementation in real use cases. Currently these tools are mainly used for the mere issuing of tokens for financial purposes.

● Among the approximately 2000 digital coins on the market, many have no real use cases and have seen their value depreciate by up to 90%, thus creating a widespread discontent among investors, especially among medium-small ones.

● The attention for dApps (Decentralized Applications that exploit blockchain technology) and for the intrinsic security that they offer, not physically possessing user data, has risen enormously: not only insiders, but also many ordinary people are now aware of the fact that the classic "data-centric" services represent a past destined to disappear in favor of an architecture that allows a high level of privacy and user control over their data.

● The language of the blockchain, like that of other technologies, is complex. The winning role of companies and developers is to make technology accessible, creating simple services that can solve real problems.
 
● Focusing on solving real problems is the key to the success of the entire ecosystem: as long as you cannot comfortably use this technology in everyday life, then it will continue to be a niche phenomenon. Our task is to transmit and build the technical infrastructure to support a widespread diffusion of blockchain technology.
